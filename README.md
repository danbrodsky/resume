Resume website (currently in development, UI complete)

The .html file includes all necessary CSS and JavaScript needed to run the site. The UI is a custom, skewed multi-panel layout styled after a mix between the engage screens in original Pokemon games and the loading screens in fighting games and DOTA2. Uses parallax effect and nested elements to give the site as much space for information using as little space as possible, also eliminating the need for a scroll wheel.
